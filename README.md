This repo contains all the code for a webapp built during BigRedHacks 2017. The devpost can be found [here](https://devpost.com/software/no-more-stupid-questions).

The backend is a flask server that utilizes websockets to transmit data to the VueJS frontend. You can try it out by cloning the repo and running ```python app2.py```.
